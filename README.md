# FrontEnd-projects
Frontend projects using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fantastic for grasping web fundamentals. They offer a direct way to understand how structure, styling, and interactivity work together. While modern frameworks offer more features, these projects build a solid foundation. They are also excellent for showcasing core skills in a portfolio.
